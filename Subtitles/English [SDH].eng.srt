[Nina]  The reality of an elite

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
it's no joke, Pop.

Yeah, when I left, y'all were,

"It's gonna be great. Go show
'em who we are. Go represent."

The truth is...

463
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
is that most of the time I'm
at Stanford feels like a

her plate into my arms

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and said, "I ordered the
vegetarian option."

-No.
-Yeah.

Well, why would you do that?

491
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Because you sold half the

1675
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
There's plenty like me,
here and over there.

1676
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Stop!

1677
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Yo, you're an artist.

1678
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yo, your senior year
lab book...

1679
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I should've been
paying attention

1680
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
all them doodles you made.

1681
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Yo, it was like...

1682
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Wonder Woman  meets...

1683
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
The Simpsons  meets...

1684
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Guernica.

1685
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
-[Vanessa laughs]
-And I would...

1686
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I would watch, like...

1687
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I just want to see
the whole world

1688
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
[Kevin chuckles]
Mira para allá.

1689
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Benny, you know,
before I bought Rosario's...

1690
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
it was O'Hanrahan's.

1691
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
The whole block was Irish.

1692
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
[chuckles]

1693
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You know why I bought it?

1694
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
My dad, he, uh... he pulled me
out of high school,

1695
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
so that I could work on
the same farm as him.

1696
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Making the same pennies.

1697
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I thought to myself,
"No, no, no,  papi."

1698
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
"That don't make no sense."

1699
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'm gonna drop out
so somebody else

1700
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
So I came here.

1701
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So I could make
my own damn work.

1702
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
But, you never
finished high school?

1703
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But Nina did.

1704
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
[Usnavi]  You asked me,
"What a  sueñito  means?"

1705
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm not gonna sit here
and give you

1706
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
some fairy tale version.

1707
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
You know, a dream isn't some
sparkly diamond we get.

1708
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
You know, sometimes, it's...
it's rough.

1709
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And it's not so pretty.

1710
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
-Yeah!
-  [speaking Spanish]

1711
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
[in English] DACA was not
a gift from some benevolent

1712
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
-No.
-No!

1713
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
-[protest leader] You made
it happen, you fought for it.

1714
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
[protest leader] And that's why
it still continues now.

1715
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
'Cause what about the people
who don't qualify,

1716
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
She gets into college
without papers, but...

1717
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
no work-study for her,
no federal aid for her

1718
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
so she doesn't
get to go to college.

1719
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
-What did she say?
-She said her niece

1720

We can dream bigger

1721

Yo, Sonny!

01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
What's going on man?

1723
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
[protest leader]
Let's do this. Yes!

1724
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I knew I couldn't
get a license.

1725
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But no college?

1726
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
She was talking
about undocumented folks.

1727
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I remember when I was your age,
they used to say...

1728
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
"If you work hard
and you live by the rules,

1729
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
the money will come,
the things will come.

1730
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And that, those things
will complete you."

1731
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But, they won't.

1732
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
We work so hard to try
and get there, that we forget

1733
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I was gonna be like you.

You've given me
this amazing education

1742
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
and figure out how
every undocumented kid

Maybe Stanford isn't a way out.
Maybe it's a way back.

This is the moment
when you do better than me.

Not because of
some fancy degree...

It's 'cause you can
